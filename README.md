## Project Overview

Jimi's is a website for a ficitious blues-themed cafe, record shop and live music venue. The website would be used to provide new/returning customers with essential information about the venue, such as contact information, opening times, etc., and pursuade potential customers to visit.

**Business Objectives**
- To increase sales and footfall at the venue.

**User Stories**
- As a user, I want the website to give me a feel for the venue and convince me to visit by eliciting an emotional response through powerful and compelling content.
- As a user, I want to be able to easily find information I require for my visit, such as opening times, contact details, live music information and cafe menu items.
